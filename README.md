Welcome to the AngularThreejsDemo project! This cutting-edge Angular application combines the power of Angular with the immersive world of Three.js to create stunning 3D experiences.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

ng serve
Then, navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

🛠️ Code Scaffolding
Generate new components, directives, pipes, services, and more with Angular CLI. Here's an example to get you started:

ng generate component component-name
🏗️ Build
To build the project for deployment, use the following command:

ng build
The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.

🧪 Testing
Execute unit tests using Karma by running:

ng test
🌐 End-to-End Testing
Run end-to-end tests using a platform of your choice with the following command. Be sure to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities first:

ng e2e
